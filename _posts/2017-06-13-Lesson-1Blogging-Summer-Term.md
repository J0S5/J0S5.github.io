    <td>In the lesson we were asked to complete a username and password system. I started off trying but to no avail, then we went to the front and Mr Keen showed us a way of doing it, which I barely understood. He then started off by showing us how to code a sum function, that was easier but I didn't manage it in the lesson and finished it for homework.</td>
